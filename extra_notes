Things we may wish to consider

paths to other logs....

path to apache log /var/log/httpd/access_log

paths to other logs, use try, catch etc...?

/var/log/messages : General message and system related stuff
/var/log/auth.log : Authenication logs
/var/log/kern.log : Kernel logs
/var/log/cron.log : Crond logs (cron job)
/var/log/maillog : Mail server logs
/var/log/qmail/ : Qmail log directory (more files inside this directory)
/var/log/httpd/ : Apache access and error logs directory
/var/log/lighttpd/ : Lighttpd access and error logs directory
/var/log/boot.log : System boot log
/var/log/mysqld.log : MySQL database server log file
/var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log : Authentication log
/var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp : Login records file
/var/log/yum.log : Yum command log file.

worth checking for /home usernames and creating a weighted alert based on that?
worth adding email functionality to get out report.html?

find safest way to run as some sort of cron? Make that customisable?
