Things to Do:

Fix the Menus! User input of path to log file to be used. Do something about the other hardcoded paths. Checks for other services (Apache, su failures …). Add nmap functionality, option to nmap ip address of ‘attackers’ Check legalities* Make script installable. Investigate whether load balancers affect socket.gethostbyname() – are we getting the server IP or the loadbalancer IP? Ditto firewalls Add other OSs Be able to pipe the failed passwords into a file and diff it with know wordlists to identify bots/skiddies Create alert if passwords are non-standard Create aleart if username is not on the common lists Offer option to grep the database to see if the non-standard user is there- indicating possible database breach Work towards a structured approach to storing examples of attacks to check for Build WAMN site and offer options to contribute results to big ass real time map
Create an aleart feature if these are different i.e. breached datdbases and those non-standard creds used
Offer option to grep databases to check this
Anything else anyone can think off, please just say!
